1. Do I keep LR scheduler for PPO? Probably not
2. Do I run the reference model with do_recog enabled?
    (a) We wont have it for the active model or PPO so maybe not?
3. Commit to a standard logging format.
    (a) This either means converting all of the PPO related code to Tensorboard
    (b) Or converting all of the JoeyNMT code to Wandb (maybe Nikunj or Priyanshu already did this?)
